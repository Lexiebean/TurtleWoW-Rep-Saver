Thinking of race changing on Turtle WoW? Save a backup of your rep before you do.

This _might_ assist GMs if there's any errors during the race change process.
It exports your rep in a CSV format. Copy/Paste it to somewhere like a spreadsheet.

Obviously this is plain text that anyone could edit. So it should be used with a massive grain of salt.

Take your own screenshots before you race change too.

**Use `/repsave` to save your rep.**
